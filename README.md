#UseEffect
// UseEffect just another normal javascript function with some superpowers given by react. 
// UseEffect takes two arguments. One a callback function(arrow function) and the other is dependency array.
//Question here arises when did the callback function will get called in this useEffect. 
//It will be called right after our component gets render. Once our component gets as soon as it finishes the rendering it will call the callback function of useEffect.

# 2 Types Routing in web app
- Client side routing:- The client side routing is basically already has page loaded and kept. We don't need to make a network to reload our page or fetch specific page. We are implementing client side routing.
- server side routing:- We make a call to network and the network gives the page for ex /about page is fetched and you get the details of /about page. That is called as server side routing.
