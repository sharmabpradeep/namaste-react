#UseEffect
// UseEffect just another normal javascript function with some superpowers given by react. 
// UseEffect takes two arguments. One a callback function(arrow function) and the other is dependency array.
//Question here arises when did the callback function will get called in this useEffect. 
//It will be called right after our component gets render. Once our component gets as soon as it finishes the rendering it will call the callback function of useEffect.
